# AtliQ-Hardware-Data-Analytics-Project


## Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of over 1 million rows, using **SQL** for data exploration and Power BI for modeling, data cleansing, and visualization. The primary goal is to provide insights into different business areas through a comprehensive data model and KPIs built in Power BI.

## Project Structure
- **SQL Exploration & Data Cleansing**: Initial exploration and cleaning were done using SQL, connecting to the data source directly and optimizing the dataset for Power BI modeling.
- **Power BI Data Modeling**: Power BI was used to create a robust data model, including calculated columns and measures using DAX and further cleansing using Power Query.
- **Key Views**:
  - **Market View**
  - **Finance View**
  - **Supply Chain View**
  - **Sales View**

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Finance View
The following KPIs were created in the **Finance View** to track the financial health of the business:
- **Gross Margin %**: Measures the percentage of revenue remaining after deducting the cost of goods sold.
- **Net Profit %**: Represents the percentage of net income relative to total revenue.
- **Net Sales**: Tracks total revenue from sales after returns, allowances, and discounts.

### Supply Chain View
In the **Supply Chain View**, the KPIs help monitor the efficiency and accuracy of supply chain operations:
- **Forecast Accuracy**: Compares forecasted demand against actual demand to measure prediction accuracy.
- **Net Error**: The difference between actual and forecasted values, showing the deviation.
- **Net Profit**: Also tracked here to understand profitability from a supply chain perspective.

### Data Model
The data model was constructed in Power BI by establishing relationships between key tables.
Power BIâ€™s data model allows for dynamic reporting and the ability to slice and dice the data based on various dimensions like time, region, and product categories.

### Data Cleansing
Data cleansing was performed using:
- **SQL**: To filter and remove anomalies.
- **Power Query**: Further cleansing was performed in Power BI to handle missing values, duplicate records, and transform columns as needed.
- **DAX**: Measures were created using DAX functions to add custom calculations and KPIs to the data model.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the power of combining SQL and Power BI for large-scale data exploration, modeling, and visualization. By organizing data into distinct views and KPIs, we provide actionable insights across multiple business functions.
